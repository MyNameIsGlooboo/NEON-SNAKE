Step 2 status: completed for provided files.

Summary:
- app.py has already been removed (per your message and plan.md). Among the files you added to the chat (snake_game.html, snake_game.css, snake_game.js, plan.md, tests/test_files_exist.py) there are no server-side Python artifacts, DB files, or other server-only files to delete or archive.
- Therefore, step 2 (remove/archive server-side artifacts from the static deploy target) is already done for the files you've shared.

If you have other server-side files elsewhere in the repository (examples: server.py, api.py, wsgi.py, requirements.txt, Procfile, any .py implementing a Flask/Django API, or *.db files), please add their exact paths or add those files to the chat. I will then prepare SEARCH/REPLACE edits to either delete them or move them into an archive folder (e.g., archive_server/) and provide the exact git commands to apply.

Suggested commands you may run from the repository root to confirm status:
git status
git log -1 --pretty=oneline
pytest -q
