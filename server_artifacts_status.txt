Step 2 status: completed for provided files.

Summary:
- app.py has already been removed (per your message and plan.md). Among the files you added to the chat (snake_game.html, snake_game.css, snake_game.js, plan.md, tests/test_files_exist.py) there are no server-side Python artifacts, DB files, or other server-only files to delete or archive.
- Therefore, step 2 (remove/archive server-side artifacts from the static deploy target) is already done for the files you've shared.

CI / Deployment updates performed:
- Added a CI workflow at .github/workflows/ci.yml that runs pytest -q on push and pull requests to ensure the repository's tests pass automatically.
- Added a GitHub Pages deploy workflow at .github/workflows/deploy_pages.yml which uploads the repository root and deploys it to GitHub Pages on push to the main branch (enable Pages in repo settings to publish).

Status of remaining plan items:
- Step 3 (client-side scoreboard) — done.
- Step 4 (optional remote submission path) — done (frontend posts to /api/scores and falls back to localStorage).
- Step 5 (CI / Tests) — done (CI workflow added). You can run pytest locally with pytest -q.
- Step 6 (Deploy to static host) — added a GitHub Actions deploy workflow; additional repository settings (enable Pages) may be required to publish.
- Step 7 (centralized server) — still optional and not created here.

Suggested commands you may run from the repository root to apply and verify:
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/deploy_pages.yml plan.md run_commands.sh server_artifacts_status.txt
git commit -m "ci: add CI and GitHub Pages deploy workflows; update plan and scripts"
pytest -q
